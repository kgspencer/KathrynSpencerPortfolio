        <p>
          I'm Kathryn, an undergraduate developer and aspiring technologist.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm passionate about design, front-end development, and UI/UX. I have recieved formal
          education in computer science and programming and work well within the fast-paced
          technical workflow that professional programming entails. I also have a long-lasting
          appreciation for graphic design and visual storytelling. Fostering these two passions
          led me to pursue front-end development and design, where I now hope to turn my passion
          into professional experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Foundational to my passion for design is my belief that code is first and foremost
          for people. I strive to design with real people and experiences in mind and create
          products that are effective in practice, not just in theory.
        </p>
        <p> I am currently pursuing a degree in computer science from Mount Holyoke College.</p>
